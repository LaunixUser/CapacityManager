# CapacityManager
A Java library to support the reporting of employee capacity - where they are, what they are working on etc. 

This is still some steps away from being ready for a 1.0 release and a lot of work is in progress. I'm also just starting to get documentation in place about concepts etc. 

Please be patient, this needs work ... but I'm on it.
